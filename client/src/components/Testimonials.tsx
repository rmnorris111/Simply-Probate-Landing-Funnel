We were dealing with a small estate where the deceased and his surviving spouse lived in Europe, but where we had to obtain Probate in NZ in order to deal with a single asset. Rion has a very efficient process which made everything happen without hiccup. His charge was well below the competitive quotes of other law firms and represented excellent value. I have no hesitation in recommending his services.",

    quote: "Simply Probate is a breath of fresh air in the world of legal companies. I am so glad such a firm exists. Their service is great. They respond promptly and do an outstanding job. Their price is also very good. More importantly I like the business model that they use. Their process is very transparent. While they generate the application for probate document based on data I entered in an online form, they allow me to submit the application to probate and therefore I am in charge. This is such a contrast to other legal firms where you have no control over what happens and pay a very high fee.",
